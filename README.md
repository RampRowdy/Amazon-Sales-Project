Amazon Sales 2025

Amazon Sales Dashboard (2025) – Excel Project
This is a sales analysis dashboard I created using Microsoft Excel based on fictional Amazon sales data for the year 2025. The goal of the project was to explore sales performance across different product categories, locations, and customer segments using only Excel—no code or external tools involved.

What I Built
A clean, interactive dashboard that lets you filter data by product, category, and month using slicers.

Visual summaries including:

Total sales by product category

Top 5 customers based on purchase value

Sales distribution across U.S. cities

Month-wise sales trends throughout the year

What I Learned
How to work with pivot tables and slicers to create a user-friendly and dynamic experience.

Techniques to design clear, focused visuals that communicate insights quickly.

How to handle and organize raw data for dashboard-ready summaries.

Key Takeaways
Electronics and Home Appliances were the top-performing categories.

Sales peaked in February and March, with noticeable drops afterward.

Olivia Wilson was the highest-spending customer, followed closely by Jane Smith.

This was a fun project to work on and a good exercise in building a full dashboard using just Excel.
